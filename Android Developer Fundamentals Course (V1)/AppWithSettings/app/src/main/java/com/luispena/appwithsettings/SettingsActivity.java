   * se a specialized Fragment subclass to display a list of settings.
   * The best practice is to use a regular Activity that hosts a PreferenceFragment that displays the app settings.
   * Fragments like PreferenceFragment provide a more flexible architecture for your app, compared to using activities alone.
   * A fragment is like a modular section of an activityâ€”it has its own lifecycle and receives its own input events,
   * and you can add or remove a fragment while the activity is running.
